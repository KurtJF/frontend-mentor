          I received a job offer mid- course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny&apos;s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an <br />amazing experience here. I signed up for
            the<br />
            free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks<br />
            was the best - and most grueling - time of my<br />
            life. Since completing the course, I&apos;ve <br />successfully
            switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as
            an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
            a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
